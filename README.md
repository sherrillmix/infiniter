# infiniter: Fit Bayesian infinite mixture models


## Introduction

This package is a work in progress.

## Installation
To install directly from github, use the [<code>devtools</code>](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) library and run:

```r
devtools::install_github("sherrillmix/infiniter")
```

This packages depends on the ``rjags`` package and that package requires JAGS to be installed so you may need to install JAGS outside R (an error like "error: automatic detection of JAGS failed"). In Ubuntu, you can just do ``sudo apt install jags``.
